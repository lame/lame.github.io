## Visuospatial Reasoning

Knowledge wherein causality is, at most, implicit

Ex. write a story given a picture

Can we just use similar mapping of actions to picture w/o abstracting causal patterns

AI agent creates propositional representation out of visuospatial reasoning -> Archydas

## Analogical Representation

- Analogical reasoning - think semantic nets x to y
  - amodal representation
- Analogical representation - think picture to picture w/ afine mutations
  - modal representation

## Systems Thinking

Multiple levels of abstractions including some invisible layer that needs to be inferred

### Structure-Behavior-Function

- SBF, but not the bitcoin one...

- Level 1: what does a flashlight do
- Level 2: structure of the flashlight
- Level 3: behavior - state-transitions-state transitions
