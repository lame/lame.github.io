<li>If problems are well formed, means-ends analysis and problem reduction can work well</li>
<li>Weak method (makes little use of knowledge)</li>

<ul>
<li>Initial state and goal state, the path along is a means of solving the problem</li>

<ul>
<li>Positive steps reduce the difference between the current state and the goal state, think the <code>a*</code> algorithm</li>
<li>Example of a universal AI method</li>
<li>No guarantee of optimality, or even being able to solve the problem</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-reduction">Problem Reduction<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#problem-reduction"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decompose a hard problem into several smaller, easier problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about how recurrsive solutions work to solve problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the block stacking example, decompose the final state into a series of "milestones" that are more likely to lead to a successful solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not provide guarantees of success</p>
</li>
