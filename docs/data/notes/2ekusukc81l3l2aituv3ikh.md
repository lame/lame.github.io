## Mistakes in Knowledge, Reasoning and Learning

## Gaps in Knowledge and Reasoning

Form reasoning goals to ask itself to connect gaps in knowledge using other cases from memory

## Streategy Selection and Integration

strategy integration is shifting from one strategy to another.

Ex. Metacognition chooses generate-and-test for all the strategies and determines the best, then moves to means-end analysis because it's best.

## Meta-cognition

Metacognition and deliberation are overlapping

Metacognition helps w/ strategy selection

- constraint propagation
- case-based reasoning
- planning
- etc.

For each strategy it can select sub-tasks, recursively.

Represented by a two layer loop between deliberation and meta-cognition
