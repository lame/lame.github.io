<ul>
<li>
<p>Superficial: deals with features, counts, objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep: deals with relationships between objects, relationships between relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semantic: conceptual similarity between target and source case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pragmatic: similarity of <strong>external</strong> factors, such as goals</p>

<p>Structural: similarity between representational structures</p>

<p>Case base reasoning is very similar to analogical reasoning, but analogical reasoning has a mapping and transfer step in addition.</p>
<h3 id="retrieval">Retrieval<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#retrieval"></a></h3>
<p>When talking about the relationship of an electron to a neutron in an atom, retrive example of planet relationship to sun in the solar system.</p>
<p>Type of similarity is important, see ##Similarity</p>
<p>case-based reasioning would likely only pull superficially similar or deeply and superficially similar analogies.</p>
<h3 id="mapping">Mapping<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#mapping"></a></h3>
<p>What in the source problem pertains to what in the target problem.</p>
<p>Solve the correspondence problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>give higher-order relationships priority over lower-order relationships</li>

<li>patient/army analogy mapping should be based on goal. Army's goal is to kill king, laser's goal is to kill tumor</li>

<h3 id="transfer">Transfer<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#transfer"></a></h3>
<p><img src="/./assets/analogical_reasoning_target_source.png" alt="target/source"></p>
<p>Once correspondence has been established:
induce a pattern of relationships</p>
<ul>
<li>goal: kill king / remove tumor</li>
<li>obsticle: road mines / healthy tissue</li>
<li>resource: soldiers / lasers</li>
<li>strategy: decompose resource, arrive at location at the same time</li>

<p>In a graphical representation, the vertices represent the objects and features, the edges are representing relationships</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#evaluation"></a></h3>
<p>Evaluation can reach out to prior states, such as retrieval, mapping or transfer to help a source get closer to the goal.</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#storage"></a></h3>
<p>Store case and solution as a source case and keep for case-based reasoning</p>
