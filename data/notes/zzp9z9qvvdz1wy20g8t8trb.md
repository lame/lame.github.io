## Design & Configuration

- We already know all the components, just need to configure to fit the problem

- Input: needs, goals, functions
- Output: Artifact that satisfies those needs, goals or functions
- With design, both the problem and solution evolve together
- Think AI agents that design AI agents

Configuration: A problem-solving activity that assigns values to variables to satisfy constraints.

### Configureation Process

![configuration process](./assets/configuration_process.png)

- Start at the top left w/ specifications (think footprint of the basement example)
- Begin abstract and refine/expand on each iteration
- Middle method of abstract and partial solutions can be represented as a design plan
  - Specifies all the variables of the plan
  - ex. number of stories the house has
- Lower level plan or refinement
  - ex. plan for each of the stories of the house
- the arrangement may cause new specifications to come about, the process repeats

- Output the arrangement model

## Plan Refinement

## Connection to Earlier Topics

### Classification

- Similar to classification system of `loop(assign, refine)`
- classification is a way of making sense of the world
- configuration acts on the world

### Case-Based Reasoning

- CBR: Starting from a specific chair and tweaking as needed
- Conf: starting w/ prototype concept and assign values and variables to meet constraints

### Planning

- A planner that generates a plan
- Confiuguration
