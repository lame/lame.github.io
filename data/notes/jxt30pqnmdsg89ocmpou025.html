<p>Explain why an error led to a failure</p>
<ul>
<li>The cup example of explaining what a cup is based on attribtutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The agent created an explanation of a cup, but it was incorrect, how does it correct for what made the explanation incorrect?</p>

<p>How can the agent isolate the error in it's former model?</p>
<ul>
<li>Venn diagram where left circle is characteristics of a positive example
<ul>
<li>Right circle is characteristics of a negative example</li>
<li>The right outer join of the venn diagram are "false suspicious features"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to attempt to correct, the agent can retry with just false suspicious features to see if that feature is a negative characteristic</p>
<p>Algo for isolating mistakes:</p>
<pre><code>To find all suspicious true-success relations:
- Intersect all true success $\bigcap T$
- Union all false successes $\bigcup T$
- Remove assersions in union from intersection $\bigcap T - \bigcup F$

To find all suspicious false-success relations:
- Intersect all false success $\bigcap F$
- Union all true success $\bigcup T$
- Remove all assersions in union from intersection $\bigcap F - \bigcup T$

<p>How can the agent explain the problem that led to the error?</p>
<p>"Why is the handle being fixed important to an item being a cup?"</p>
<p>Without explaining the mistakes, the agent can't truly learn and create optimal entries in the tree</p>

<p>How can the agent repair the model to prevent the error from recurring?</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors can be in agent model or agent architecture</li>
</ul>
